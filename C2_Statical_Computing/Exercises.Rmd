Exercise 2.2:

Use seq(–2,2,.1) to obtain a range of x values for input to the probability function
f (x) which is defined as

f (x) = 2x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 && 0 elsewhere.
```{r}
f <-function(x){
  return(ifelse(0 <= x & x <= 1,2*x,0))
}
x = seq(-2,2,.1)
#print("x:")
x
#print("f(x):")
sapply(x,f)

```

Exercise 2.3:

Write R code to find the squares of the numbers from 1 to 25 and plot the numbers
on the x axis and their squares on the y axis. Hint: you can use the c() operator to
append an element to a vector.
```{r}
x = c(1:25)
plot(x,x^2,type = 'l')
```
